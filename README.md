ðŸ“Š Cancer & Geospatial Dashboard
This interactive Streamlit dashboard explores the relationship between cancer disease metrics and environmental (geospatial) factors across selected countries in the Americas. It enables users to filter by country, gender, cancer type, and time range (2000â€“2021), and analyze how metrics like Total Incidence, Crude Rate, and ASR (Age-Standardized Rate) vary over time and correlate with environmental data such as COâ‚‚ emissions, PM2.5 levels, temperature, humidity, and precipitation.

The dashboard includes:

Dynamic charts with YoY trends and scatter plots

A cancer-type distribution diagram (treemap) for the latest year

A correlation matrix between cancer types and environmental metrics

Intuitive sidebar filters for streamlined navigation

This project offers valuable insights into potential links between environmental exposure and cancer metrics, useful for researchers, students, and policy professionals.
